# jekyll-webpack-template

Starter project for getting nice PostCSS webpack build into a simple jekyll static site.

- no `_posts`: no blog by default
- no `javascript`: the webpack build is for `css` only
- menu helper include

Built with `jekyll` and `webpack`. The layout and menu is in `_includes` and `_layouts`. CSS is built with `PostCSS` and is located in `_css` [ignore the `.js` file, it's just so `webpack` understands the dependency tree].

**Do not edit `_site`**, this folder is the output generated by `jekyll`. It will be overwritten.

The main content of the site is in:

- `index.md`
- `careers/`

Any other site section we want to add, just make a new folder named with the desired path, put a `index.md` in there, and any other sub-pages named as `page-path.md`.


# Development

### Setup

Requires `ruby`, `rubygems` with `bundler`, `node` with `npm`

1. `bundle install`
1. `npm i`


### Local Development

This needs to be better, but works for now.

1. `npm run dev-webpack` in one terminal window
1. `npm run dev-jekyll` in another


### Deploy

Needs to be set up with AWS S3 keys, then just run `npm run deploy` and up it goes!
